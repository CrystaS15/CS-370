The I/O bound program (cpu-print) has more voluntary and involuntary context switches. It has more voluntary context switches because the program is frequently making a system call that blocks. The I/O bound program (cpu-print) also has more involuntary context switches because it doesn't run for very long before making another system call that to give up the CPU. The compute bound program (cpu) uses more system time because it spends most of its time using the CPU to compute.
